	man, everything about this video is perfect <br><br>

i’m not sure if i’m just getting swept up in the nostalgia of being an impressionable middle schooler who stanned over Odd Future, (i never copped the doughnut socks tho, so was i really a true OF fan???) but this video is exactly how i hope my life ends up. a bunch of homies on the peak of success, about to blow the fuck up just through being themselves and doing what they love. like the amount of pure excitement and joy that everyone in the room has is incredibly inspiring. every single one of em are stoked to be there and are feeding off each other’s energy. even when i listen to the song on spotify, i can still vividly hear the whole squad mobbing around jasper as he’s about to spit half of his verse (6:13).  <br><br>

and as corny as this may sound, from the perspective of a young kid who was trying to find his people and his own place in the world, this video taught me to not settle on some fuck-ass friend group who doesn’t share that same level of happiness for one another. it also showed me that whatever i pursue in the future, that i SHOULD have that infectious Earl Sweatshirt grin on my face. (speaking of which, that cloud shirt is still fuego) <img src = "https://i.imgur.com/IzXKhe3.png"><br><br>

but as i lay here in bed, a few days away from my accounting midterm, i realized that i never really reached anywhere close to that level of friends and excitement for the future. business fucking blows man, i hate it so much. i hate that everyone takes themselves so seriously, and that everything needs to be by the books and anything outside of the convention is wrong. (i’m not even just talking about accounting, cause that shit needs to be by the books or the IRS is gonna come fuck you.) it’s soul crushing and my classes bum me the fuck out every single day. one of my homies is a graphic designer and i’m so fucking jealous of her curriculum and what she gets to learn. <br><br>

i listened to Oldie a couple hours ago and then watched the music video for the first time in a while. it still gets me in that zone. it makes me hopeful that one day i’ll have that squad and be able to be myself and be on the rise from pursuing something that i absolutely love. 

fuck man, i gotta study some accounting bullshit now. i might hate every moment of it, but ya boy is not trying to flunk out just yet haha.
